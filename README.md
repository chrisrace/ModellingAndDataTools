# ModellingAndDataTools
Course material for third year module in the Materials Science undergraduate course at University of Manchester, UK

The material is in .zip archives and is in the form of jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and supporting files (data, images, etc.). The notebooks can be used in any order, but there are a few cases where the intended order of delivery (Optimisation -> Atomistic Simulation -> Phase Filed -> Machine Learning) introduces concepts progressively. In each case there is a .zip archive with the version for students to work through in class and a version including solutions to the tasks.
